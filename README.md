# James Song 🚀🤖

I'm James Song, a CS major at the University of 〽️ichigan. I am passionate about deep learning, and I am particularly interested in autoregressive models, natural language and image generation 📝🖼️. I'm also interested in transformers and the theory behind how they learn representations 🔄🧠.

## Weekly Challenge
Starting from September 2024, I am attempting to reproduce some results from a recently published research paper every week. 

September 7: Linear Mode Connectivity and the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis [ [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05671), [repo](https://github.com/james-hx-song/lmc-transformers) ]
