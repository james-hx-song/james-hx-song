# James Song 🚀🤖

I'm James Song, a CS + math major at the University of 〽️ichigan. I am passionate about deep learning, and I am particularly interested in autoregressive models, including natural language generation and image generation 📝🖼️. Recently, I've been also interested in transformers and how they learn representations 🔄🧠.

## Weekly Challenge
I reproduce a recently published research paper every week, starting Sep 2024. 

September 7: Linear Mode Connectivity and the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis [ [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05671), [repo](https://github.com/james-hx-song/lmc-transformers) ]
